BUILDING:

To compile you'll need Haskell (obviously), as well as the Network.HTTP and
TagSoup libraries. Both are available through cabal if they aren't in your
package manager.

If you need to get them through cabal, install cabal through your package
manager then do

cabal update
cabal install http
cabal install tagsoup

then compile with

ghc --make -O3 cardInfo.hs

or, if you want to use multiple cores you can do

ghc --make -O3 -threaded cardInfo.hs

however we're mostly bound by the network and not wanting to open up too many
concurrent connections and killing our network (or looking like a DOS), so
there isn't a tremendous amount of benefit.  You can play around with the
"threadMax" and "threadWaitTime" if you want to eek out better performance.

USING:

once you've built the program just run it with

./cardInfo <min> <max>

where min is the card you want to start with, and max is the card you want to
end with.  Everything is written to stdout so you probably want to redirect to
a file.

If you want everything in a cards.out file use

./cardInfo 1 222923 > cards.out
